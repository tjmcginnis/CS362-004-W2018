Bug #1
==============================

Title: Smithy does not add three cards

Class: Serious Bug

Date: 3/4/2018           
Reported By: Tyler McGinnis 
Email: mcginnit@oregonstate.edu 


Product: dominion
Platform: Ubuntu                Version: 16.04 LTS
Platform: CentOS (Oregon State flip server)
Shell: bash

Is it reproducible: Yes


Description
===========
When smithy is played, three cards should be drawn from the current player's
deck and placed in his hand, however it appears that the number of cards in
the player's deck is not as expected after smithy is played.

This error arose from a game state containing a valid current player, deck,
deckCount, hand, handCount, discard, discardCount, numActions, and phase.

To add some context, this error arose specifically from calling the playCard
function with 0 as the first argument (smithy is in the first position of
the hand) and a valid gameState, and checking that the current player's 
deckCount is three less after calling the function than it was prior to calling
the function.

Error Messages:
From cardtest1_mcginnit.c:
  smithy: FAIL -- it has 3 less cards in the deck


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
From terminal:
make cardtest1_mcginnit
./cardtest1_mcginnit


Expected Results
----------------
Expected the current player's deckCount to be decremented by 3 after the call
to playCard.

Actual Results
--------------
The current player's handCount was not decremented by 3 after the call to
playCard.

Platform: CentOS (Oregon State flip server)
Shell: bash

Is it reproducible: Yes


Description
===========
When the Village card is played, gameState.numActions should be incremented
by 2.

This error arose from a game state containing a valid current player, deck,
deckCount, hand, handCount, discard, discardCount, numActions, and phase.

This error arose specifically from calling the playCard function with 0 as the 
first argument (village is in the first position in the hand) and a valid
gameState, and checking that gameState.numActions was 2 greater after calling
playCard than it was before calling playCard.

Error Messages:
From cardtest3_mcginnit.c:
  village: FAIL -- it adds two actions
From randomtestcard1_mcginnit.c:
  Failing: gain 2 actions

This error happens repeatedly with both unit and random tests.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
From terminal:
make randomtestcard1_mcginnit
./randomtestcard1_mcginnit

OR

make cardtest3_mcginnit
./cardtest3_mcginnit


Expected Results
----------------
The numActions property of the gameState to be incremented by 2 after the call
to playCard.

Actual Results
--------------
The numActions property of the gameState was not incremented by 2.
